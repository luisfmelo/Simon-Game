# Simon Game - Free Code Camp

<strong>User Story</strong>: I am presented with a random series of button presses.

<strong>User Story</strong>: Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.

x <strong>User Story</strong>: I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.

<strong>User Story</strong>: If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.

<strong>User Story</strong>: I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.

<strong>User Story</strong>: If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.

<strong>User Story</strong>: I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.

<strong>User Story</strong>: I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
